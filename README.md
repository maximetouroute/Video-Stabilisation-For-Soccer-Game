# Stabilisation-For-Soccer-Game

## Description
This is a code snippet from a project aiming to highlight events in soccer game videos.
It uses the characteristics of a soccer game video to separate camera movements and subject movements.

The main algorithm based on an optical flow analysis can then be more accurate by analyzing player movements without the noise infered by camera movements

Developped with OpenCV 2.*

## How to use
